# CyberSecurity

Step 1: Measure and Set Goals
Answer the following questions:
Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.


                Loss of control and visibility of company related data being transmitted, stored and processed.
                Personal device could be lost with login credentials in it.
                Susceptibility to man in the middle attacks and eavesdropping at public hotspots.


Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?
For example, if employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, the preferred behavior would be that employees only download attachments from trusted sources.
Use only company approved and provided apps for handling work data.
Refrain from having company login details saved on the device.
Only use secure networks, office wifi or home wifi.
What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?
For example, conduct a survey to see how often people download email attachments from unknown senders.
Monitor company provided app usage.
Change login credentials on a quarterly basis policy.
Monitor login traffic to reveal unknown IP addresses.
What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?
For example, to have less than 5% of employees downloading suspicious email attachments.
80 % usage of company approved and provided apps.
5% unauthorized logins.
5% login traffic from unidentified IP addresses.
Step 2: Involve the Right People
Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?
Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.
CISO
The Chief Information Security Officer will be ultimately responsible for threat assessment and risk mitigation strategies. He or she will present our plan to the CIO and COO first,  and then CEO.  
CIO
The Chief Information Officer will evaluate together with the CISO the apps and technology necessary for the implementation of the plan. He or she will help evaluate the plan from the technology point of view.
COO
The Chief Operation Officer will consider the viability of the programme. He or she will evaluate the impact on overall productivity.
CEO
The Chief Executive Officer will weigh the advantages of increased security vs the potential loss of employee performance. He or she will ultimately sign the approval of our programme. 
HR 
The head of Human Resources will assist us with their department in developing a campaign to communicate the changes in company policy.
They can assist with scheduling as well as proposing disciplinary or reward measures. 
Step 3: Training Plan
Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:
How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both) 
Training will be delivered through e-learning modules, to be completed at a due date including a quiz.
Followed by an in-person on day training and discussion. 


What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)
Topics included in the training are: 
Introduction to Cybersecurity
Potential threats we face
Cost of falling victim to cyber attacks
New procedures and technology 
Training on the Apps
Questions and suggestions


After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness?
Hiring penetration testing consultants and reporting successful attempts. 
Monitor intrusion attempts.
Monitor unidentified devices connected to the network.
Monitor approved app usage.
Monitor non-human traffic on our network.
Keep track of cybersecurity incidents reported.


This portion will require additional outside research on the topic so that you can lay out a clear and thorough training agenda.
Bonus: Other Solutions
Training alone often isn't the entire solution to a security concern.
Indicate at least two other potential solutions. For each one, indicate the following:


What type of control is it? Administrative, technical, or physical?


What goal does this control have? Is it preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating?


What is one advantage of each solution?


What is one disadvantage of each solution?
											
Implement a policy compliance reward programme. 
This is an administrative control and its goal is to ensure all employees are using only company provided apps to access work files from their personal devices. 
This goal is corrective of a bad habit, that of using any app of choice by the user to access work related data. 
The advantage of implementing a reward programme is higher employee compliance as it may be seen as fun, engaging and encouraging. 

 A possible disadvantage of spoiling employees with rewards may cause non compliance of policy when new programmes are launched without the use of rewards.


Deploy canaries in the network to report suspicious behavior. This is a technical control with a detecting goal. The advantage of the birds is that it is a “set and forget” system which will notify only when a serious intrusion is taking place. The disadvantage is the subscription to be paid for the service.
